This demo site was made and spun by Andrea1 in acouple hours ~~while banging head on the wall~~ after work. This is purely meant as a demostration and is NOT a complete demo nor a complete demostration of this theme.

Geekdoc is a simple Hugo theme for documentations. It is intentionally designed as a fast and lean theme and may not fit the requirements of complex projects. 

Here is the link to the project I am using as a base for this AWCY? docs idea https://geekdocs.de/
