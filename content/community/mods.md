## 1. Protecting the vibe
A mod will fight to keep AWCY? an open and enjoyable place to hang out. Feeling free to
express our artistic vision is important to the health of AWCY?, and the vibe should
represent that. This responsibility includes redirecting political conversations to the
appropriate rooms, and helping conversations follow the flow of the room. Other examples
would be enforcing rule 3 on racism and generally being an asshole, or jumping in to help
someone who is getting talked over in general or the lobby.

## 2. Enabling Development
A mod will help be the support system for people hoping to develop new and exciting DIY
or printed guns. This involves making new rooms for new projects, helping connect devs to
resources, and making sure beta testers know what’s available to test. Additionally, this
involves supporting the release of projects when they are ready to go into the wild. A mod
will help, if asked, get readmes and guides sorted, help figure out release timelines and
videos, and generally be the fixer for dev.

## 3. Encouraging growth in the community
The most important resource AWCY? has is the wide variety of talents, capabilities, and
knowledge base present among the community. Encouraging the growth of that community
through engaging with newbs in the lobby is an important portion of the job. In addition,
this means policing the public areas of AWCY? to keep our public facing rooms welcoming
and clean for new members who might have a lot of trepidation in joining us. This also
includes setting a good example in interviews, and attempting to be as fair and unbiased as
possible when dealing with people who you might otherwise ignore.

## 4. Deal with the administration and support of the team
The nitty gritty details. Running and implementing community votes, breaking up or
resolving interpersonal fights that spill over into dev channels, keeping a transparent log of
mod actions in glass houses, and ensuring we aren’t about to be deplatformed all fall under
this role. It’s grunt work, but someone’s got to do it.
