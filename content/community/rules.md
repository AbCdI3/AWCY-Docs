We don’t have many rules 

but rule 2 is that rule 1 is forbidden to be written down and must be passed from OG to noob.

### Rule 3
 is that if you're racist, we'd prefer you not to be one, but we understand that assholes need friends too, so we ask you don’t be racist in our team, and hopefully you'll grow out of it.

### Rule 4
 is to read the room and go with the flow of the conversation, and remember that even if things get heated, you’re still on the same side.

### Rule 5
 is that shitposting is permitted anywhere, but if someone tries to get back on topic, you yield the conversation to them so they get the help they need. Except Community_Proposals, and The Casting Couch we like to keep proposals for serious discussions relating to the group and the couch for interviews.

### Rule 6
 is we really ask that you don’t share our models until they’re officially released to the public. We don’t want to get people hurt for thinking our testing files are ready to go when someone passes them out too early.

### Rule 7
 is Are We Cool Yet? will not be used to conduct regular sales or start any business venture. This rule includes selling regulated items without an FFL while using a username associated with the team. This rule also includes recruiting "business partners” through the team. This rule does not apply to AWCY? merchandising and Developers retain control and rights of their own models.

### Notice:
People are big on anonymity around here. You are free to dox yourself. But most try to minimize the identifiable stuff they share. 

Also, just a last note. Don't try to dox other people here or from other GunCAD groups. That's as about as big an offense we have here.

### AWCY Lobby rooms notice:
1. All the above rules and warning equally apply.
2. If you think it is a good idea to join a group of underground gun makers and start threatening them, and/or target and attack members. We will ban you. We draw the line at any threats of violence 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## In short:
Keep our optics clean and don't force us to babysit a bunch of violent extremists while they pass around our files like a blunt.

## As an AWCY? member, you agree that:

We Take no sides

We Tell no lies

The Art is all
