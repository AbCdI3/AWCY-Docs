AWCY? understands that your gun may not workout for a rlease with the above release criteria, so make your case for your gun to release not matching the above release criteria in Community Proposals(compromp) to the group. Ex: single-shot guns, expensive or hard to find parts kits for your frame or receiver, phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range, a SCCY, etc...
